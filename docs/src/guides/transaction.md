# Transaction

TiDB supports ACID transactions, which ensure data consistency and reliability.

## Basic Usage

=== "Python"

    ```python
    with db.session() as session:
        initial_total_balance = session.query("SELECT SUM(balance) FROM players").scalar()

        # Transfer 10 coins from player 1 to player 2
        session.execute("UPDATE players SET balance = balance - 10 WHERE id = 1")
        session.execute("UPDATE players SET balance = balance + 10 WHERE id = 2")

        session.commit()
        # or session.rollback()

        final_total_balance = session.query("SELECT SUM(balance) FROM players").scalar()
        assert final_total_balance == initial_total_balance
    ```
